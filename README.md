# Golf-Bot
Golf-BOT is an Arduino-based autonomous robot that locates, tracks, approaches, and strikes a golf ball using Pixy2 computer vision (Signature 1) and servo motor control. A proportional controller keeps the ball centered while driving, and once close (pixel width threshold), the bot aligns, nudges forward, and performs a putting swing.
